Initial Scene Description wrt logical predicates?

Predicates. do them when in replay mode

save stuff in json format?
use relevant predicates from visual genome dataset
json_dataset, predicates: ["on", "wear", "has", "next to", "sleep next to", "sit next to", "stand next to", "park next", "walk next to", "above", "behind", "stand behind", "sit behind", "park behind", "in the front of", "under", "stand under", "sit under", "near", "walk to", "walk", "walk past", "in", "below", "beside", "walk beside", "over", "hold", "by", "beneath", "with", "on the top of", "on the left of", "on the right of", "sit on", "ride", "carry", "look", "stand on", "use", "at", "attach to", "cover", "touch", "watch", "against", "inside", "adjacent to", "across", "contain", "drive", "drive on", "taller than", "eat", "park on", "lying on", "pull", "talk", "lean on", "fly", "face", "play with", "sleep on", "outside of", "rest on", "follow", "hit", "feed", "kick", "skate on"]

filtered predicates:
["on", "wear", "has", "next to", "stand next to", "walk next to", "above", "behind", "stand behind",  "in the front of", "under", "stand under", "near", "walk to", "walk", "walk past", "in", "below", "beside", "walk beside", "over", "hold", "by", "beneath", "with", "on the top of", "on the left of", "on the right of", "carry", "look", "stand on", "use", "at", "attach to", "cover", "touch", "watch", "against", "inside", "adjacent to", "across", "contain", "taller than", "eat", "lying on", "pull", "talk", "lean on", "fly", "face", "play with", "outside of", "rest on", "follow", "hit", "feed", "kick"]

further filter:
["on", "next to", "above", "behind", "in the front of", "under", "walk", "in", "below", "beside", "hold", "on the top of", "on the left of", "on the right of", "carry", "use", "cover", "touch", "contain", "eat", "pull"]

further filter:
["on", "next to", "in", "walk", "hold", "use", "cover", "touch", "eat"]

ROGER:
on, above, in, cutting, holding moving
cutting: read the cuts replay file
holding: record when hands grasp action is used
moving: compare last frame to current frame. if position and rot diff > threshold then object is moving. use recording file


make grasping more intuitive: 
highlight currently selected object (like it was before), but only make it visible for the ego perspective

create videos

maybe instead of reading cooking instructions --> let speech generator read out loud the cooking instructions?

The bounding box cubes don't have the right names attached, but in general have ok positions. Where is the mixup?
Can handle multiple materials now, but still with name mixup. occurs around id #132

start and stop the recording and playback via function call and not via start/awake/update

in recording mode: stockt, wenn die json files geschrieben werden.
--> schreibe json files, wenn in playback mode?
