Create Game Startup Manager for setting perform or render mode, file names, etc
Create a visualization of my table to put down controllers
Record status of some interactable objects (water faucet, stove flames)

put each recording (i.e. multiple text files) into one new folder
Handle end of recording

create datastructure that handles cut objects (i.e. tree for each object that has ever been cut)


fix handling of cut objects
    the newly cut objects cannot be picked up
    do new and old objects after cut have correct colliders etc?

when cutting:
sometimes no ObjectID script is attached to a newly created object. Then also no grasp ghost is created and the object isn't interactable.
(in Cutter.cs script)
(error in objectID.cs: maybe the error here leads to not instantiating objectID.cs
cucumber_10
UnityEngine.Debug:Log(Object)
ObjectId:OnCollisionEnter(Collision) (at Assets/Scripts/ObjectId.cs:134)

child cucumber_1Ghost

After a cut, one of the two new Gameobjects still has the old ghost shape (i.e., the original shape before cut)
    --> write function to update ghosts too after cut 
    
 Record faucet and oven status
 
 Make hands move in playback mode
 
 Create all Recordings when in playback mode:
    Ego RGB
    Object mask
    Depth
        How many angles?
    Ego RGB
    Ego Object mask
    Ego Depth
    
    Annotation
        Pose
        Orientation
        Bounding box
            For all rendered objects
        Object mask color mapping for all objects
        Predicates
            Grasp
            On
            In
            (see Rogers email)
       
            
 Manager for replay file parts
    Set text for record name?
     
                 
 Improve Avatar
    Legs should make steps
    Hands should not detach from arms
    Collisions between avatar and furniture?
         
Change Gloves?

In objectid.cs in oncollisionenter
                //TODO Not all objects have this apparently? or maybe ghosts are queried for children, which they dont have?

Footsteps

cutting: still problems with the ghosts.
just make a new ghost for the original (left) GO and destroy old one. then the naming is correct, too for the ghost.

Initial Scene Description wrt logical predicates?

Predicates. do them when in replay mode

save stuff in json format?
use relevant predicates from visual genome dataset
json_dataset, predicates: ["on", "wear", "has", "next to", "sleep next to", "sit next to", "stand next to", "park next", "walk next to", "above", "behind", "stand behind", "sit behind", "park behind", "in the front of", "under", "stand under", "sit under", "near", "walk to", "walk", "walk past", "in", "below", "beside", "walk beside", "over", "hold", "by", "beneath", "with", "on the top of", "on the left of", "on the right of", "sit on", "ride", "carry", "look", "stand on", "use", "at", "attach to", "cover", "touch", "watch", "against", "inside", "adjacent to", "across", "contain", "drive", "drive on", "taller than", "eat", "park on", "lying on", "pull", "talk", "lean on", "fly", "face", "play with", "sleep on", "outside of", "rest on", "follow", "hit", "feed", "kick", "skate on"]

filtered predicates:
["on", "wear", "has", "next to", "stand next to", "walk next to", "above", "behind", "stand behind",  "in the front of", "under", "stand under", "near", "walk to", "walk", "walk past", "in", "below", "beside", "walk beside", "over", "hold", "by", "beneath", "with", "on the top of", "on the left of", "on the right of", "carry", "look", "stand on", "use", "at", "attach to", "cover", "touch", "watch", "against", "inside", "adjacent to", "across", "contain", "taller than", "eat", "lying on", "pull", "talk", "lean on", "fly", "face", "play with", "outside of", "rest on", "follow", "hit", "feed", "kick"]

further filter:
["on", "next to", "above", "behind", "in the front of", "under", "walk", "in", "below", "beside", "hold", "on the top of", "on the left of", "on the right of", "carry", "use", "cover", "touch", "contain", "eat", "pull"]

further filter:
["on", "next to", "in", "walk", "hold", "use", "cover", "touch", "eat"]

make grasping more intuitive: 
highlight currently selected object (like it was before), but only make it visible for the ego perspective

check if video screen still works
create videos

maybe instead of reading cooking instructions --> let speech generator read out loud the cooking instructions?

Particles
The current solution currently doesn't handle slower replay times. Look if this is ok, when you stop time when you render videos.

The bounding box cubes don't have the right names attached, but in general have ok positions. Where is the mixup?
Can handle multiple materials now, but still with name mixup. occurs around id #132
