create datastructure that handles cut objects (i.e. tree for each object that has ever been cut)


fix handling of cut objects
    the newly cut objects cannot be picked up
    do new and old objects after cut have correct colliders etc?

when cutting:
sometimes no ObjectID script is attached to a newly created object. Then also no grasp ghost is created and the object isn't interactable.
(in Cutter.cs script)
(error in objectID.cs: maybe the error here leads to not instantiating objectID.cs
cucumber_10
UnityEngine.Debug:Log(Object)
ObjectId:OnCollisionEnter(Collision) (at Assets/Scripts/ObjectId.cs:134)

child cucumber_1Ghost

After a cut, one of the two new Gameobjects still has the old ghost shape (i.e., the original shape before cut)
    --> write function to update ghosts too after cut 
    
 Record faucet and oven status
 
 Make hands move in playback mode
 
 Create all Recordings when in playback mode:
    Ego RGB
    Object mask
    Depth
        How many angles?
    Ego RGB
    Ego Object mask
    Ego Depth
    
    Annotation
        Pose
        Orientation
        Bounding box
            For all rendered objects
        Object mask color mapping for all objects
        Predicates
            Grasp
            On
            In
            (see Rogers email)
       
            
 Manager for replay file parts
    Set text for record name?
     
                 
 Improve Avatar
    Legs should make steps
    Hands should not detach from arms
    Collisions between avatar and furniture?
         
Change Gloves?

In objectid.cs in oncollisionenter
                //TODO Not all objects have this apparently? or maybe ghosts are queried for children, which they dont have?


Record colors of all cut objects in cut map. This must include all intermittent cut objects, too.

In playmodemanager, record mode:
So, the hand should be recorded now. Next, instantiate the slim render model (clone), deactivate steam vr scripts and the
animator, then set the single joints according to the recordings. Note: some joints are probably in local space, not 
world space.


Put hand recordings in 2 separate files. dont mess with the regular game objects
dont put the hand render model in the regular poserot dict during replay
