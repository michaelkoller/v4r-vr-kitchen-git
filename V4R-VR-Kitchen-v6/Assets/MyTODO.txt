Handle end of recording
Link the start record command to the record button on controller
make recording mode be startable from script
    
fix handling of cut objects
    the newly cut objects cannot be picked up
    do new and old objects after cut have correct colliders etc?

when cutting:
sometimes no ObjectID script is attached to a newly created object. Then also no grasp ghost is created and the object isn't interactable.
(in Cutter.cs script)
(error in objectID.cs: maybe the error here leads to not instantiating objectID.cs
cucumber_10
UnityEngine.Debug:Log(Object)
ObjectId:OnCollisionEnter(Collision) (at Assets/Scripts/ObjectId.cs:134)

child cucumber_1Ghost

-----


After a cut, one of the two new Gameobjects still has the old ghost shape (i.e., the original shape before cut)
    --> write function to update ghosts too after cut       
                            
 Improve Avatar
    Legs should make steps
    Hands should not detach from arms
    Collisions between avatar and furniture?
         
Change Gloves?

In objectid.cs in oncollisionenter
                //TODO Not all objects have this apparently? or maybe ghosts are queried for children, which they dont have?

Footsteps

cutting: still problems with the ghosts.
just make a new ghost for the original (left) GO and destroy old one. then the naming is correct, too for the ghost.

Initial Scene Description wrt logical predicates?

Predicates. do them when in replay mode

save stuff in json format?
use relevant predicates from visual genome dataset
json_dataset, predicates: ["on", "wear", "has", "next to", "sleep next to", "sit next to", "stand next to", "park next", "walk next to", "above", "behind", "stand behind", "sit behind", "park behind", "in the front of", "under", "stand under", "sit under", "near", "walk to", "walk", "walk past", "in", "below", "beside", "walk beside", "over", "hold", "by", "beneath", "with", "on the top of", "on the left of", "on the right of", "sit on", "ride", "carry", "look", "stand on", "use", "at", "attach to", "cover", "touch", "watch", "against", "inside", "adjacent to", "across", "contain", "drive", "drive on", "taller than", "eat", "park on", "lying on", "pull", "talk", "lean on", "fly", "face", "play with", "sleep on", "outside of", "rest on", "follow", "hit", "feed", "kick", "skate on"]

filtered predicates:
["on", "wear", "has", "next to", "stand next to", "walk next to", "above", "behind", "stand behind",  "in the front of", "under", "stand under", "near", "walk to", "walk", "walk past", "in", "below", "beside", "walk beside", "over", "hold", "by", "beneath", "with", "on the top of", "on the left of", "on the right of", "carry", "look", "stand on", "use", "at", "attach to", "cover", "touch", "watch", "against", "inside", "adjacent to", "across", "contain", "taller than", "eat", "lying on", "pull", "talk", "lean on", "fly", "face", "play with", "outside of", "rest on", "follow", "hit", "feed", "kick"]

further filter:
["on", "next to", "above", "behind", "in the front of", "under", "walk", "in", "below", "beside", "hold", "on the top of", "on the left of", "on the right of", "carry", "use", "cover", "touch", "contain", "eat", "pull"]

further filter:
["on", "next to", "in", "walk", "hold", "use", "cover", "touch", "eat"]

ROGER:
on, above, in, cutting, holding moving
cutting: read the cuts replay file
holding: record when hands grasp action is used
moving: compare last frame to current frame. if position and rot diff > threshold then object is moving. use recording file


make grasping more intuitive: 
highlight currently selected object (like it was before), but only make it visible for the ego perspective

check if video screen still works
create videos

maybe instead of reading cooking instructions --> let speech generator read out loud the cooking instructions?

Particles
The current solution currently doesn't handle slower replay times. Look if this is ok, when you stop time when you render videos.

The bounding box cubes don't have the right names attached, but in general have ok positions. Where is the mixup?
Can handle multiple materials now, but still with name mixup. occurs around id #132


see if bounding boxes break when cutting --> yes, rightgo(?) shows up with a black texture on segmentation screen
in colorbynumber, access allGameObjectsWithRendererDict in recordobjectposrot. allGameObjectsWithRendererDict has all current objects with renderer.


start and stop the recording and playback via function call and not via start/awake/update

in recording mode: stockt, wenn die json files geschrieben werden.
--> schreibe json files, wenn in playback mode?

schneiden --> greifen --> schneiden: greifen geht dann nicht mehr.  (mit out of bounds exception --> ghost ist kein child, daher findet cut() den ghost nicht)
