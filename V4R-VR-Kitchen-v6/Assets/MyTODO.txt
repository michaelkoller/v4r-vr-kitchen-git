create datastructure that handles cut objects (i.e. tree for each object that has ever been cut)


fix handling of cut objects
    the newly cut objects cannot be picked up
    do new and old objects after cut have correct colliders etc?

when cutting:
sometimes no ObjectID script is attached to a newly created object. Then also no grasp ghost is created and the object isn't interactable.
(in Cutter.cs script)
(error in objectID.cs: maybe the error here leads to not instantiating objectID.cs
cucumber_10
UnityEngine.Debug:Log(Object)
ObjectId:OnCollisionEnter(Collision) (at Assets/Scripts/ObjectId.cs:134)

child cucumber_1Ghost
UnityEngine.Debug:Log(Object)
ObjectId:OnCollisionEnter(Collision) (at Assets/Scripts/ObjectId.cs:135)

UnityException: Transform child out of bounds
ObjectId.OnCollisionEnter (UnityEngine.Collision collision) (at Assets/Scripts/ObjectId.cs:133)

-----

Record cut actions on objects and just recreate the cuts 

Automate file reading for test and testcut files

After a cut, one of the two new Gameobjects still has the old ghost shape (i.e., the original shape before cut)
    --> write function to update ghosts too after cut
